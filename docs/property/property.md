## Property Based Testing

The point is made that with a CI process in place you can automate testing in your code base but there is still a dilemma on how many test cases to write.

Do you write one test case or many test cases?

> In practice, much time is devoted either to simplifying a failing case by hand, or to debugging and tracing a complex case to understand why it fails. Shrinking failing cases automates the first stage of diagnosis, and makes the step from automated testing to locating a fault very short indeed

#### Test Case Wisdom
* During regular test case scenarios in unit-testing your follow the happy path or normal path
    * This in turn forms basis for future test cases
* By generating test cases you can find bugs faster and more accuracy is what I am gleaning from the paper

* It is better to run smaller tests than large tests.
* Most errors can be found by a smaller test case.

* Developer will jump onto the first failing case
* Rerun the test case and start debugging the issue
* Test cases generated by hand are time consuming as well
* When new test cases can be generated by hand in seconds it helps reduce developer time on trivial edge cases.

### TestCheck.js

Generative property testing for JavaScript.

TestCheck.js is a library for generative testing of program properties, ala QuickCheck.

* By providing a specification of the JavaScript program in the form of properties
* Properties can be tested to remain true for a large number of randomly generated cases.
* In the case of a test failure, the smallest possible failing test case is found.


```javascript
const { check, gen, property } = require('testcheck');
const test = require('tape');

test('addition is commutative', check(gen.int, gen.int, (t, numA, numB) => {
  t.plan(1);
  t.equal(numA + numB, numB + numA)
}));
```
