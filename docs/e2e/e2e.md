#### Definition of End-to-End Tests via InfoQ [End-To-End-Testing](https://www.infoq.com/articles/balancing-unit-and-end-to-end-tests) 
End-to-End Tests simulate user behavior. In a web application, they will start the server, fire up a browser, click around, and assert that certain things happening in the browser give us confidence our feature is working. These tests give great confidence, but they are slow, brittle, and tightly coupled to the user interface.
