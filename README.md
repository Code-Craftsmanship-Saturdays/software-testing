# Code Craftsmanship Saturdays Fourth Session

To view lecture notes for this course, please consult the
[github-pages](https://code-craftsmanship-saturdays.github.io/software-testing).

This meetup event gives an introduction to unit testing, integration testing,
and end-to-end-testing. We will also go over Mocks, Stubs, and Spies.

# Assignments

Each assignment folder has several exercise files. 
Read the instructions.md file in order to complete the exercises.
Some assignments may or may not have a program.js file that you will test.
Each assignment will have a file called program.test.js.
program.test.js will be where most of the logic exists per each test.

## Unit Testing

A unit test is an automated piece of code that invokes a unit of work in the system and then checks a single assumption about the behavior of that unit of work.
A unit of work is a single logical functional use case in the system that can be invoked by some public interface (in most cases).
A unit of work can span a single method, a whole class or multiple classes working together to achieve one single logical purpose that can be verified.
